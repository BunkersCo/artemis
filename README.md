# ARTEMIS

ARTEMIS is a defense approach versus BGP prefix hijacking attacks (a) based on accurate and fast detection operated by the AS itself, leveraging the pervasiveness of publicly available BGP monitoring services and their recent shift towards real-time streaming, thus (b) enabling flexible and fast mitigation of hijacking events. Compared to existing approaches/tools, ARTEMIS combines characteristics desirable to network operators such as comprehensiveness, accuracy, speed, privacy, and flexibility. With the ARTEMIS approach, prefix hijacking can be neutralized within a minute!
